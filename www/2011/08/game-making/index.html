			 	<h1>My First Foray Into Game Making</h1>
				
			  	<span class="post-date">Thu, Aug 4, 2011</span>
				
			      <p>This past weekend I went to Dallas to visit a friend. We&rsquo;d always shared an interest in games, but over the last six months, my friend had actually started to code his own games from scratch. Quite frankly, I was impressed. While I&rsquo;ve delved into many different coding projects over the last few months, I&rsquo;d actually forgotten about one of my original goals; to develop a game. While my friend&rsquo;s games were not masterpieces, he had made several fun clones of games like Mario Kart, and a maze game with Pokemon sprites. Most of these he coded in DarkBasic.</p>

<p>Naturally, after playing around with the games a bit, we decided to continue improving them. Coding isn&rsquo;t much of a two-person job though, so eventually I started work on my text-based RPG I wrote in Ruby two years ago. It seems that we both have a touch of programming ADD though, and my friend started a new 2D fighting game (which I&rsquo;ll add is coming along nicely) and I wrote <a href="https://gist.github.com/1126940">restaurbot</a>, a simple and comical restaurant robot.</p>

<p>It was at this point that I emailed my dad, asking for advice on creating text-based games in Ruby (what I had wasn&rsquo;t working too well). He provided me with many links, but most were graphical. This, of course, intrigued me. Could I achieve what my friend was doing in a simpler language I already understood?</p>

<p>This particular link was to a Ruby library called <a href="http://www.libgosu.org/">Gosu</a>. This library allows you to easily create games in Ruby or C++. Getting started was simple: <code>sudo gem install gosu</code> did the trick (I installed the other gems suggested on the homepage later). With the help of the simple tutorial on <a href="https://github.com/jlnr/gosu">Gosu&rsquo;s github page</a>, I had a game with working controls and graphics up within twenty minutes.</p>

<p>When I showed this to my friend and told him how easy it was, he wanted to try it for himself. I helped him install Ruby on his XP machine, and most of the gems ran smoothly, and he quickly learned how Gosu and Ruby work (in fact, he&rsquo;s about to send me the game files he&rsquo;s been working on).</p>

<p>The real fun started when we began modifying the Gosu example projects that come with the gem. <em>(Note: We had no luck finding the directory on my friend&rsquo;s machine, so I sent him my files, which, due to RVM, were located in</em> <code>~/.rvm/gems/ruby-VERSION/gems/gosu-VERSION/examples</code>).</p>

<p>The CptnRuby example was definitely the most fun to change. It provides a great starting code base for a sidescroller (which I&rsquo;m in fact using for my next project). The example shows you how to get images from tilesets and implement gravity, both useful, especially if you want to make a platformer.</p>

<p>When I really started enjoying and understanding Gosu, however, was after watching the <a href="http://ruby4kids.com/ruby4kids/public/web_page/14">ruby4kids screencasts</a> on it (lame, I know). My first game, <a href="http://benbailey.me/spritedodge/">SpriteDodge</a>, is based off of the example project they create there.</p>

<p>Once you get off the ground, you&rsquo;ll find Gosu very easy to use and logical in its implementation into one of many&rsquo;s favorite programming languages.</p>

<p>If you get stuck with Gosu, make sure you check the <a href="http://www.libgosu.org/rdoc/">Ruby rdoc</a> for information, or hop in the #gosu channel on freenode.net (the people there are very helpful). If you need art for your games, you should check out <a href="http://lostgarden.com">lostgarden</a>, or do a quick Google search for &lsquo;free game assets.&rsquo; And when you finish your first game, feel free to post it in the <a href="http://www.libgosu.org/cgi-bin/mwf/board_show.pl?bid=2">showcase section</a> of the Gosu forums. Enjoy, and good luck!</p>
