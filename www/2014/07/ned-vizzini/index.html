			 	<h1>I wish I&#39;d written you a letter</h1>
				
			  	<span class="post-date">Sun, Jul 20, 2014</span>
				
			      <p>I spent the afternoon lost in Ned Vizzini’s <em>Teen Angst? Naah…</em>, a collection of short essays about his experiences as a teenager. It’s candid, thoughtful, and entertaining.</p>

<p><span class="more"></p>

<p>Ned Vizzini also wrote <em>It’s Kind Of A Funny Story</em>, a book based on his week-long stay in a mental hospital that changed his life. The book itself went on to change so many other lives.</p>

<p>He killed himself last winter.</p>

<p>I don’t know why.</p>

<p>This book affected me more than most books I’ve read. I’m not sure why. The last chapter is a note from Ned about what happened to him after high school. He sounded like he was doing so well. He <em>was</em> doing so well. And now he’s gone.</p>

<p>Maybe I feel this way because, in a strange way, he reminded me of me. He went to a magnet high school, was rather socially awkward, etc. But I feel like anyone could relate to his experiences. <em>Teen Angst?</em> makes Ned Vizzini feel like a real person. It reads as if he&rsquo;s hanging out in your dorm room and sharing stories about high school.</p>

<p>I wish I could have got to know him. I feel like I missed out on an opportunity to make a new friend, even though I doubt I ever would have met him. He seems like a great person.</p>

<p>I wish I knew why, but it doesn’t really matter. It happened, and now it’s over.</p>

<p>I miss him. And I don’t know why, but I wish he were here.</p>

<p>The book ends kind of like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I’m a writer from now on, for better or worse, and so far it’s  mostly all better…Do I have days where I wake up and no Muses are there and I don’t even want to deal with my life anymore? Sure…But above and beyond that are the days when the words come together and I sit back in my chair and go, “Man, this is fun.” And there are the days where I get an e-mail or a letter from someone who read my writing and liked it and I just slap myself in the head for an entirely different reason, because I’m blessed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish I had written you a letter, Ned.</p>
