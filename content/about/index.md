I'm a Devops and Data Engineer at Pingboard, currently in Western Massachusetts by way of Austin. Occasionally, I write about baseball at [25th Man](https://25thman.com). You can get in touch with me via [GitHub](https://github.com/benfb), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bennett), or [Email](mailto://bennettbailey@gmail.com).

A container autoscaler for Hashicorp's [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io), developed during an internship at Under Armour.

### [Elixush](https://github.com/benfb/elixush)
Elixush takes advantage of Elixir and OTP to run evolved programs across multiple nodes in a cluster. It was built as an independent study for the [Hampshire College Computational Intelligence Lab](http://sites.hampshire.edu/ci-lab/), which researches artificial intelligence and genetic programming.

### [Gorilla REPL](https://github.com/JonyEpsilon/gorilla-repl)
I maintained [Gorilla REPL](https://github.com/JonyEpsilon/gorilla-repl), a notebook-style REPL for Clojure.

### [Uncommon](https://bb.place/uncommon/)
I worked on the infrastructure for [Uncommon](https://bb.place/uncommon/), moving the project over to Docker, experimenting with AWS, and implementing a new continuous integration system.
