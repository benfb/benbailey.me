The Rockies' star player wants to be on a winner, and seems very unhappy in his current situation. The Cubs' star player seems happy enough, but the Cubs seem unlikely to sign him to an extension.

I think Bryant has a higher ceiling, but Arenado has a higher floor due to his excellent defense.

The sticking point, for me, is why if the Cubs were willing to go over the luxury tax for the right player, they wouldn't have signed more substantial major-league depth pieces over the winter.

So, while I'd love to have Arenado on the team, and can see the appeal of trading for him. But I'm reminded of all the missed opportunities of the last several months, all the relievers who the Cubs passed by due to lack of money.

An Arenado trade would leave the Cubs stuck in the middle, a place they've seemed to be wanting to escape all offseason.
