Long time, no see. I won't be writing weekly during this short season, but I'll post what I do write here when the mood strikes.

What follows is a breakdown of all nine relievers currently in the Cubs' bullpen.

### Craig Kimbrel

What he's done:

20 BF, 6 H, 7 R, 2 HR, 5 BB, 2 K, 23.63 ERA, 17.97 FIP

Why he's done it:

Kimbrel's velocity is still down 2 MPH from his peak in 2017, but he's actually throwing a touch harder than last year. While this might mean the Cubs won't see Kimbrel at his best, the stuff still looks good enough for him to be a good reliever. However, some combination of lack of command and different mechanics is leading to one of the worst relief seasons in baseball.

What to look out for going forward:

A key metric to watch? It took until his fourth outing for Kimbrel to get a whiff on his curveball. While Kimbrel has always had variation in his release point for his two pitches, there is more differentiation between the two so far this season. Not only that, both release points are lower than usual.

The Cubs recently acknowledged that the low release point is part of the problem:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ross said focus with Kimbrel is to get pitch characteristics back to prior levels. That means limiting use of changeup, which Kimbrel had talked about working in more.<br><br>&quot;We found that changeup, at times, can drop his arm and really get some things that can create bad habits.&quot;</p>&mdash; Jordan Bastian (@MLBastian) <a href="https://twitter.com/MLBastian/status/1292544554642608129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The main thing to watch with Kimbrel going forward is the release point and how Ross decides to get him opportunities.

### Jeremy Jeffress

What he's done:

20 BF, 0 H, 0 R, 0 HR, 1 BB, 4 K, 0.00 ERA, 2.63 FIP

Why he's done it:

Despite having lost 2-3 MPH on each of his pitches since his All-Star 2018 season with the Brewers, Jeffress has quickly worked his way up the bullpen hierarchy. He's throwing a substantially different pitch mix--in 2017 he threw his curve the most (30.8% of his pitches), and in 2018 he favored the sinker (34.1%), but so far this year he's thrown his splitter most frequently (36.1%).

What to look out for going forward:

Jeffress is one of Ross' two most-trusted relievers at the moment. Outside of Kimbrel, he has the most experience as a closer, so I would assume it is his job to lose. I'd like to see his velocity tick up a bit as the season goes on and for hime to get a few more strikeouts, but it's hard to complain when the rest of the bullpen has been as bad as it has been.

### Rowan Wick

What he's done:

16 BF, 4 H, 0 R, 0 HR, 1 BB, 2 K, 0.00 ERA, 2.69 FIP

Why he's done it:

Wick has thrown his curveball almost 40% of the time this season, around 10% more than last season. His velocity is down very slightly, but he looks a lot like the pitcher we saw last year.

What to look out for going forward:

The lack of strikeouts is a little concerning, but Wick is sitll getting soft contact. He probably has better stuff than Jeffress at this point and is next in line for the closer role, though I like him more as a fireman.

### Kyle Ryan

What he's done:

19 BF, 7 H, 4 R, 1 HR, 0 BB, 2 K, 7.71 ERA, 4.89 FIP

Why he's done it:

Ryan is the only bullpen mainstay who hasn't walked a batter this season. Unfortunately, he's gotten hit around a bit. On average, he's lost 2.9 MPH on his cutter, 2.9 MPH on his sinker, and 1.7 MPH on his four-seamer. Ryan has also had to face a slightly higher percentage of righties so far this season (68% vs. 60% last year), perhaps due to the new three-batter minimum rule. When Ryan is at his best, he's a reliable, deceptive lefty who generates a lot of groundballs and doesn't get killed by righties.

What to look out for going forward:

Ryan was a great story last year, but it's hard to see him stepping back into a late-inning role if his velocity stays down. He was already one of the softest throwers in the game, and so a substantial drop from there seems unsustainable. The good news is, it ticked up a little in his most recent outing. Ryan is the best lefty in the Cubs' bullpen, with Rex Brothers down at the alternate site and Brad Wieck on the IL. The hope is that the velocity will keep going up as he recovers from a late start to his summer camp.

### Ryan Tepera

What he's done:

18 BF, 4 H, 3 R, 1 HR, 1 BB, 8 K, 6.23 ERA, 3.66 FIP

Why he's done it:

What to look out for going forward:

### Casey Sadler

What he's done:

18 BF, 3 H, 1 R, 1 HR, 3 BB, 5 K, 2.45 ERA, 6.24 FIP

Why he's done it:

Sadler is the most interesting of the new relievers for me. On July 27th, his curveball averaged over 3100 RPM, which would be among the best in baseball.

What to look out for going forward:

Sadler's velocity dropped a little in his last outing, perhaps due to pitching on back-to-back days. It's not a huge issue, but it's worth monitoring his usage going forward. Mostly I'm looking forward to seeing if Sadler can continue to develop his curveball throughout the season.

### Dan Winkler

What he's done:

12 BF, 1 H, 2 R, 1 HR, 4 BB, 4 K, 6.75 ERA, 9.34 FIP

Why he's done it:

What to look out for going forward:

### Colin Rea

What he's done:

4 BF, 0 H, 0 R, 0 HR, 0 BB, 2 K, 0.00 ERA, -1.03 FIP

Why he's done it:

What to look out for going forward:

### Duane Underwood Jr.

What he's done:

27 BF, 7 H, 6 R, 2 HR, 3 BB, 5 K, 9.00 ERA, 7.63 FIP

Why he's done it:

It seems like Underwood sitting 95 is much harder to hit than Underwood sitting 93.

What to look out for going forward:

I'm pretty confident Underwood will be a good reliever someday. The question is, with what team? He doesn't have any options remaining.
