title: "Alec Mills: The Cubs' Third Best Starter?"
date: 2020-03-08

Alec Mills is both a modern pitcher and an anomaly.

Mills gave up his first run of the spring yesterday.

Acquired in a trade with the Royals for minor-league outfielder Donnie Dewees.

First, the negatives against Mills: his fastball spin is below average and his velocity is far below average. His curveball spin is about average.

In this way, though, Mills could succeed especially in the modern more fluent pitching staff. He's not the kind of pitcher you'd want to go deep into games, as he doesn't have the kind of stuff that will blow hitters away. Baseball Prospectus' PECOTA projection system projects him as the Cubs' third-best starter.

Mills had one of the Cubs' higher swinging strike rates in 2019, 0.9% behind Yu Darvish and ahead of Rowan Wick.

Mills isn't great at tunneling, unlike Hendricks. However, he does have good command. As seen here, Mills' slow curve has a "hump" in its path which reveals itself to hitters from both sides.
